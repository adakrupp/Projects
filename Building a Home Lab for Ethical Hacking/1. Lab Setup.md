### Introduction
This project is meant to teach me how to use MetaSploit for ethical hacking purposes, so I may understand more about red-teaming as a blue-teamer. I believe it is vital for me to understand the attacker, in order to be able to be a part of a robust defense against them. All information in this project is for learning purposes only, with the intent of adding this project to my portfolio for my cyber security career. 
#### Step 1: Setting up Kali Linux on Proxmox
In the video, VMWare is used. I, however, do not want to use this software because I already have a Proxmox server configured and ready to go. Therefore, I will be following some slightly different steps than in the video to be able to get my home lab ready.

First, I downloaded the NetInstaller from Kali's website to my proxmox server here:
https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-installer-images

Then, I went through the graphical installation process for Kali Linux, opting for 2 CPU cores and 4 gigabytes of RAM.

For now, we'll leave the network the same. Later, I'll switch this out.

![](Pasted%20image%2020250115094211.png)
After some loading, we see the following:

![](Pasted%20image%2020250115094535.png)

![](Pasted%20image%2020250115094544.png)

![](Pasted%20image%2020250115094555.png)
From here, it will begin the OS install. This took a few moments for me. It will ask if you want to create a proxy server; you can skip this step/continue.

![](Pasted%20image%2020250115095030.png)
When I got to this step, I did not change anything and pressed continue so it could install my desktop environment and tools. To be honest, it does not matter which environment you use as long as you are comfortable using it. I'm fine with any of the choices. After the install, it will ask you about the bootloader. Go through the steps as below and the installation should be ready.

![](Pasted%20image%2020250115101518.png)

Once done here, make sure to log into the Kali machine and update it.

#### Step 2: Setting up PfSense
While that was installing, I created a PfSense vm, to be used to isolate the Metasploitable box from the internet. I followed these instructions found on Reddit, with screenshots below. Keep in mind, I had to go to PfSense's website and get the netinstaller from them first, then I needed to use Gzip to unzip it before I was able to upload it to proxmox. 

```_**Proxmox Node**_
-Add a blank, unconfigured network device (e.g. a linux bridge/OVS named vmbr1). Your actual node should have at least two vSwitches now - vmbr0 which should be real and tethered to a real NIC, and this one.

_**Spin up another VM**_

Install pfSense on this VM. Give it a vNIC for both your real connection and the empty connection. When you go through installation, set the pfSense WAN interface to use vmbr0 and the LAN to use vmbr1. LAN should be a different network than vmbr0 (e.g. vmbr0 sits on a network using the 192.168.1.0 address space, vmbr1 LAN interface should be statically set to 192.168.**2**.0 or some other RFC 1918 spec'd address space.)

_**Further configuration**_

Create another VM, but with this one only give it access to vmbr1. Spin it up and assign a local IP that matches the address space you assigned to the LAN interface on pfSense (e.g. if that is 172.16.0.1, make your IP 172.16.0.2). From this box, you should be able to open a web browser and navigate to the IP you assigned to your LAN interface. Go through the webGUI quick setup, and then pay attention to the following items:

-block "RFC 1918 traffic" on both the LAN and the WAN. This will completely isolate this network. If you want connectivity out, but not in, block it on the WAN side.

-enable DHCP on your LAN interface

That simple. Of course VLAN tagging could be used too, and manually addressing things would be fine as well, this is a bit more of a robust solution. If you ever want a VM on that network you just assign it a NIC bonded to that vswitch. If you need a jumpbox from one network to your real network/another airgapped network, you just add that corresponding vNIC.
```

First, I created the new network, as instructed above.
![](Pasted%20image%2020250115095307.png)

![](Pasted%20image%2020250115095411.png)

![](Pasted%20image%2020250115095439.png)

Once I set that up, I pressed "Apply Configuration" to start the network. You can also reboot the host machine. This makes it so that anything connected to that network is able to start.

Then, I created a new virtual machine.
![](Pasted%20image%2020250115095541.png)

![](Pasted%20image%2020250115095622.png)
I left the rest of the steps at their default, including network. However, I did NOT start the machine at the final step, as we still have a network to add. 
![](Pasted%20image%2020250115095749.png)

![](Pasted%20image%2020250115095929.png)
Under Hardware of the new machine, I clicked "Add" and then added the second network device. 
![](Pasted%20image%2020250115100023.png)

![](Pasted%20image%2020250115100040.png)
Perfect! They now both show up under the hardware category. Now that that's set, I started the PfSense machine. 

![](Pasted%20image%2020250115100433.png)

![](Pasted%20image%2020250115100446.png)

![](Pasted%20image%2020250115100458.png)
The next step is important; the WAN must be vmbr0 (vtnet0), and the LAN is vmbr1 (vtnet1). This is to ensure that things are isolated correctly. 
![](Pasted%20image%2020250115100722.png)
![](Pasted%20image%2020250115100732.png)

![](Pasted%20image%2020250115100828.png)
![](Pasted%20image%2020250115100948.png)
![](Pasted%20image%2020250115101013.png)
![](Pasted%20image%2020250115101027.png)
![](Pasted%20image%2020250115101036.png)
![](Pasted%20image%2020250115101052.png)
![](Pasted%20image%2020250115101134.png)
![](Pasted%20image%2020250115101142.png)
![](Pasted%20image%2020250115101154.png)
![](Pasted%20image%2020250115101208.png)

After this, it will go through the install process. Once done, you should get a similar screen as below:

![](Pasted%20image%2020250115101431.png)

After that, the machine will reboot and it will ask you to enter the WAN and LAN interfaces. Remember to set the WAN to vtnet0 and the LAN to vtnet1. When you get to this screen (the IP may be different) we are ready to connect the Kali machine to it for final configuration.

First, you will need to connect the kali machine to the PfSense network by adding the vmbr1 bridge to the Kali machine's hardware.

![](Pasted%20image%2020250115102254.png)

![](Pasted%20image%2020250115102410.png)
Back in the Kali machine, switch your network to the second 'Ethernet' connection (the one  that is not the RedHat Virtio ethernet connection)
![](Pasted%20image%2020250115102533.png)
From there, go to the IP address of the PfSense machine and click Advanced > Accept the risk and continue.

There are some pages you can simply skip or go next on.

![](Pasted%20image%2020250115102906.png)
![](Pasted%20image%2020250115103015.png)
Set your time to your preferred timezone.
![](Pasted%20image%2020250115103118.png)
At the bottom of this page, you want to make sure this is checked; mine was by default. 
![](Pasted%20image%2020250115103150.png)
![](Pasted%20image%2020250115103211.png)
![](Pasted%20image%2020250115103232.png)
Once reloaded, go through the remaining screens, then go to interfaces > LAN at the top.

![](Pasted%20image%2020250115103344.png)
Make sure that at the bottom of this screen, you check the box, as seen below.
![](Pasted%20image%2020250115103555.png)
Next, go to Services > DHCP Server and make sure "Enable DHCP server on LAN interface" is checked. 

![](Pasted%20image%2020250115103728.png)
Alright! This should be all set and ready to go now! Go ahead and close the website when you are finished. 

#### Step 3: Create Metasploitable2 Machine

Next, the MetaSploitable2 machine needs to be created. For Proxmox, this is done most easily in the shell. 

![](Pasted%20image%2020250115103953.png)

From there, I input this series of commands:
```
wget https://sourceforge.net/projects/metasploitable/files/Metasploitable2/metasploitable-linux-2.0.0.zip


unzip metasploitable-linux-2.0.0.zip


cd Metasploitable2-Linux/


qemu-img convert -O qcow2 Metasploitable.vmdk metasploitable.qcow2


qm create 302 --memory 2048 --cores 2 --name Metasploitable2 --net0 virtio,bridge=vmbr0 --boot c --bootdisk ide0


qm importdisk 302 metasploitable.qcow2 local-lvm


qm set 302 --ide0 local-lvm:vm-302-disk-0
```

This series of commands downloads the VM, unzips it, converts it to a qcow2 file for use with proxmox, then creates the virtual machine and assigns the qcow file to it. After I was done here, I had this machine:

![](Pasted%20image%2020250115104146.png)

![](Pasted%20image%2020250115104218.png)
In the machine's settings, I removed the vmbr0 bridge so that the machine doesn't have internet access. I then added the vmbr1 bridge.

![](Pasted%20image%2020250115104319.png)
This should be all set up; in order to confirm, I need to check to make sure that the Metasploitable2 machine has LAN access, but not internet access, and that the Kali machine is able to communicate with it. To do so, I log into both and use ping to see if I lose packets. 

First, I log into the Metasploitable2 machine and check to see if I get an IP address:
![](Pasted%20image%2020250115104557.png)
Perfect, my IP is assigned to 192.168.1.101 for this machine. Next, I need to see if I can reach the internet on this machine. I ping 1.1.1.1 to see if it can connect to google. 
![](Pasted%20image%2020250115104649.png)
100% packet loss, as expected. Great so far!

Next, I logged into the kali machine to grab the IP address; while I'm there, I also ping the Metasploitable2 machine.

![](Pasted%20image%2020250115104829.png)
Great, as expected, 0% packet loss, and an IP of 192.168.1.100.
![](Pasted%20image%2020250115104916.png)
The same applies in reverse; the Metasploitable2 machine can see the Kali machine. 

With this all set up, the home lab is now officially ready!
