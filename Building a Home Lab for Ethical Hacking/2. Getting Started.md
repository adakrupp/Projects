For this project, I will be using 2 main resources; first, offsec's Metasploit Architecture page:
https://www.offsec.com/metasploit-unleashed/metasploit-architecture/

Also, the Metasploitable 2 exploitability guide:
https://docs.rapid7.com/metasploit/metasploitable-2-exploitability-guide/

Of course, I will also be using Google, ChatGPT, the video, and any other available resources needed.
